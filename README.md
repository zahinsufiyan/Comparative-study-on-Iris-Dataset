The task I am trying to formulate into a machine learning problem involves classifying the species of
given flower. In this project, I used a dataset that contained 150 observations. Each observation has
four attributes and the response variable is the type of the iris. It is a classification problem because
the response variable is the type of iris, which makes it a categorical variable. I intend to utilize three
different types of machine learning algorithm to model this classification problem. As part of our
project, I will construct three machine learning models that can classify new species of flowers based
on their sepal and petal measurements. Firstly, I plan to deploy KNN 1 classification algorithm to set
a baseline for this project. Afterwards, two more machine learning algorithms will be applied which
are: Logistic regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Lastly, a comparative study will be
conducted by implementing classification report and confusion metrix on the performance of these
three models to determine which classification model has better overall performance
